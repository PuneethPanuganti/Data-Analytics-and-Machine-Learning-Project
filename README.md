This project leverages the CRISP-DM framework to address customer segmentation and fraud detection in banking. The business understanding phase defined objectives, including clustering customers for personalized offers using K-means and classifying fraudulent activities with KNN. During the data understanding phase, data was explored, cleaned, and prepared by addressing missing values and outliers using the IQR method. In the data preparation phase, data was split into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets to prevent overfitting. The modeling phase applied K-means to identify customer clusters and key features, while KNN classified fraudulent transactions, with parameters optimized for accuracy. The evaluation phase ensured models met business goals, reviewing error rates and addressing overfitting if necessary. Finally, the deployment phase implemented scalable models, with comprehensive reporting and monitoring to deliver actionable insights for customer targeting and fraud prevention.

Using KNN, the parameter we got is 5 and the classification algorithm is used to classify the customers from the non-performers.
The Applied K-means clustering and KNN in Python to analyze 5,389 customer rows and improve segmentation for predictive banking decisions.
